# Temporal Profiles of Cacao: A Sensory Evaluation through Dominance Analysis

## Overview

This tool digitizes and standardizes the sensory evaluation of cacao and chocolate, providing a platform for capturing complex flavor dynamics with scientific precision. By moving away from paper-based forms to a digital interface, evaluators can record real-time data, ensuring consistent and comparable results across sessions.

## Evaluation Methodologies

### 1. Flavor Profiling
The application facilitates a comprehensive assessment of flavor attributes using a digital flavor wheel and radar chart.

*   **Attribute Scoring:** Evaluators rate the intensity of core attributes (e.g., Nutty, Floral, Fruity, Spicy) on a standardized scale.
*   **Visual Feedback:** The data is instantly visualized on a radar chart, allowing for immediate review of the flavor profile's shape and balance.

### 2. Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS)
TDS is a dynamic method that captures how the dominant flavor changes during the tasting experience.

*   **The Workflow:**
    *   **Start Tasting:** A timer begins as soon as the sample enters the mouth.
    *   **Record Dominance:** The evaluator selects the attribute that captures their attention as "dominant" at any given moment. A new selection automatically replaces the previous one.
    *   **Swallow:** Marking the swallow event distinguishes between the flavor release during mastication and the lingering aftertaste.
    *   **Finish:** The session concludes when no dominant sensations remain.
*   **The Result:** A temporal curve that illustrates the evolution of flavor, identifying which attributes dominate the Attack, Body, and Finish/Aftertaste phases.

## Features for Evaluators

### Multi-modal Interface
Designed for seamless use on tablets and mobile devices, the interface supports touch interactions, allowing evaluators to focus on the tasting experience rather than the data entry.

### Offline Capability
Evaluations can be conducted in remote locations (e.g., farms, collection centers) without an internet connection. Data is stored locally on the device and synchronized when a connection becomes available.

### Data Export & Reporting
*   **PDF Reports:** Generate professional reports summarizing the flavor profile and TDS curves for individual samples.
*   **CSV Export:** Export raw data for comprehensive statistical analysis or integration with other quality control systems.
